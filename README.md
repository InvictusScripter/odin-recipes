## Introduction

Welcome to Odin Recipes! This project was created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum to practice HTML, Git, and GitHub skills. The repository includes recipes for lasagna, slow cooker stuffing, and meat pie.

## Recipes

1. [Lasagna Recipe](./recipes/lasagna.html)
2. [Slow Cooker Stuffing Recipe](./recipes/slow-cooker-stuffing.html)
3. [Meat Pie Recipe](./recipes/meat-pie.html)

Each recipe includes an image, description, list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
